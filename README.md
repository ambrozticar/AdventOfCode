Goofing around with https://adventofcode.com/


For 2022 I have choosen to use Javascript and Node.js as the prefered tools for solving the puzzles, as it is ones I know best and are relatively fast and feature rich

These are by no means examples of my best "production-ready" code, but rather quick and dirty solutions to the problem, that I might or might not try to clean up after the puzzle is solved.
